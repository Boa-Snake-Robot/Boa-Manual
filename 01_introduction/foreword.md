I wish to thank all friends and colleagues who have helped me brainstorm, design and build the Boa snake robot. A special thanks to my colleagues at the ITK electronics and mechanical workshops, as well as my friends at Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem who helped me manufacture and assemble the robot
