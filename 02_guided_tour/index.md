The following sections will go through all the different systems in the Boa snake robot, showing how they work in depth, and the design choices made to end up at the final design. This section is probably most interesting to you if you intend to change, modify, service or upgrade the Boa snake robot. If you're only planning on using the robot "as is" this section might get a little technical. I strongly encourage you to read it anyways, as it will give some nice insight into why the robot behaves as it does.
